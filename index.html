        <h3 class="emr">EMR: <em> Electronic Medical Record</em></h3>
        <p>Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software is expensive and problematic to implement across most medical practices. Our electronic filing system is structured to provide the patient chart component of an EMR in a format and methodology that minimizes stress and disruption that frequently accompanies the rollout of a new software system.
Progress notes, patient information, images, prescriptions, insurance information, EOBâ€™s and other medical records are all kept in an electronic chart. The user-friendly interface means staff and physicians will come up to speed quickly and with its secure networked design, any user in the office can enjoy the benefits of the system. Nurses, receptionists, support staff, and doctors can accomplish more with less effort.
Without medical practice workflow solutions, any growing practice is challenged to keep up with patient files and the backlog of paperwork.
